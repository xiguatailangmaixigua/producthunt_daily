    "maker_introduction": "📌\nI’m Andrew, the Founder of Zencoder. In my previous organization, despite having a large engineering team with hundreds of people, we could only implement a small fraction of our ideas. Imagine how much more value we would generate if we could innovate 10 times faster. We built Zencoder to help you ship better products faster. Our coding and testing agents help developers spend less time on routine and more time creating amazing things.\n\nWe support 70+ programming languages and integrate seamlessly with VS Code, JetBrains and Android Studio, offering robust support for technologies and frameworks. Our AI research team constantly benchmarks Zencoder’s AI agents to push them toward state-of-the-art performance. As of March 2025, we’re at 60%+ on SWE-Bench-Verified and ~30%+ on SWE-Bench-Multimodal(#1), delivering best-in-class coding assistance right inside your IDE.\n\nBeyond coding, we offer 20+ DevOps integrations (making us the most integrated coding agent)—including JIRA, Sentry, GitHub, and GitLab—to help you ship faster. To help you ship better, we've built a unit testing agent for maintainable, high-quality code. With our AI Agents, speed and quality can come together; you don't have to pick one. Our unique Repo Grokking technology helps Zencoder better understand large codebases, generate, test, repair, and refine code, making your workflow smoother than ever. We’d love your feedback—what do you love, what needs tweaking, and which features do you want to see next? Thanks for stopping by.\n\nDo join our community on Slack and Discord\nUpvote\n(36)\nReport\nShare\n1d ago\nMasum Parvej\n@andrewsthoughts AI that codes, tests, and integrates with my dev tools?Brilliant\nUpvote\n(14)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@andrewsthoughts @masump Hey Masum, that's literally what we do. We have a robust technology (Agentic Pipeline) that will go through several steps. So, instead of just spitting out the first things that come to LLM's \"mind,\" we run a series of steps.\n\nWe start with code validation and testing\nOur pipeline checks generated code against your codebase, not just general syntax rules. Before generating any code, we run syntax and code correction, check imports and dependencies, and validate within your project's specifics.\n\nThen, we'll do an Automated Repair Loop.\nWhen issues are detected, agents don't give up - they initiate repair cycles. The pipeline diagnoses problems, applies fixes, and re-validates until the code meets quality thresholds - bringing you to the production-level code quality.\n\nAnd it powers all our agents through our Unified Agent Infra\nSo, essentially the same validation pipeline powers all our specialized agents. Whether generating new files, or making changes to existing ones, or making unit tests, each agent benefits from the context of your repository and continuous improvement cycles.\n\nThanks for your comment. If you are interested in joining our communities, I'd like to invite you to join our community on Slack and Discord.\n\n\n\nUpvote\n(7)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago\nDineshan\nLaunching soon!\n@andrewsthoughts @masump @vibor_cipan The deep IDE integrations, strong AI benchmarks, and Repo Grokking tech set it apart. Congrats on the launch\nUpvote\n(9)\nReport\nShare\n13h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@andrewsthoughts @masump @dineshan_sithamparanathan Thank you — your comments are spot on! Deep IDE integrations, 60%+ SWE-Bench scores, and Repo Grokking make Zencoder a standout for developers. We’re happy with the early response and value your support.\n\nStay tuned for more at our 6 PM CET webinar! Feel free to join if you are around - we'll be demoing all these things and more: https://zencoder.ai/webinars/maximize-productivity-with-zencoder\nUpvote\n(7)\nReport\nShare\n13h ago\nPooran Prasad Rajanna\n1Page\n@andrewsthoughts Love it\nUpvote\n(6)\nReport\nShare\n12h ago\nshow more replies\nSimona O'Neill\nSounds amazing ! Congrats on the launch. 🙂 I know how useful these type of tools are for people like me, who aren’t coders. I’m using Claude at the moment, what would make me switch to your solution instead?\nUpvote\n(9)\nReport\nShare\n14h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@simona_o_neill3 that's a fair question and I'll try to give a meaningful answer!\n\nWhile Zencoder works great even for people who are not pro engineers, people who are technical or semi-technical generally get the most out of it. That being said, for example, I don't know much about Kotlin mobile app development, but I was able to use Zencoder in Android Studio to build some mobile apps.\n\nOne of the most significant differences between us and just using one LLM is the fact that we are eliminating the entire process of copy-pasting different file versions, and you have it all in one nice and professional IDE. Even if you need to team up with pro engineers later on, they can take the code and environment over easily.\nAdditionally, we are not using just one model. In the background, we rely on a family of different models, each primed for specific tasks. We have 5-9 models and their instances running at any given moment based on different tasks.\n\nSo, while Model A can be excellent for code generation, it might be less optimal for code completion than Model B. So, we follow the \"best tool for the job\" approach and dynamically, in the background, figure out which models to use for you - so for one subscription, you are getting a bunch of models, each optimized for specific tasks.\nAlso, we have something called an agentic pipeline. So instead of just using the code that Claude spits out (and you might need to fix), we will first try running it, check for its syntax correctness, do some reviews and even self-repair it so you don't end up with the first thing that comes to LLMs' \"mind\" but code that's at or very, very close to the production level.\n\nHope this helps and gives you some context.\n\nAlso, if you are interested in joining our communities, I'd like to invite you to join our community on Slack and Discord.\nUpvote\n(10)\nReport\nShare\n14h ago\nSimona O'Neill\n@vibor_cipan wow great answer and totally makes sense now. Thank you 😉I see the price is pretty much the same too so I’ll be definitely checking it out !\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n12h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@simona_o_neill3 Thanks, let me know if you have any other questions, happy to help!\nUpvote\nReport\nShare\n11h ago\nSimona O'Neill\n@vibor_cipan ok, I’m impressed. I integrated Zencoder with my VS Code and I love how I can chat to the agent directly in my dev environment, push suggested commands in one click etc. Very cool. It does require a bit more prompting in terms of getting Zencoder to amend the provided code for example . Claude automatically offers me an amended version but here I had to ask for it. And I wish there was an option to add screenshots in the chat , but overall it’s definitely a very cool product 🙂\nUpvote\n(2)\nReport\nShare\n10h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@simona_o_neill3 At the bottom of the chat window, there is a toggle Coding Agent Beta, make sure to turn it on, and then it will generate all the diffs for you and you can easily apply them - no need to do it manually.\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n10h ago\nshow more replies\nTigran Karakhanyan\nsuch a crowded space, it takes real guts to step into it despite the aggressive competition.\n\ngood luck, guys! hope it works out.\nUpvote\n(16)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@tigran_iii You are 100% right, but we've been working on this for quite some time, have good scores, and users love it. Thanks for your comment and feedback.\n\nIf you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to share it with us. We reply to every comment and take it very seriously as we build the best possible agent and assistant for every engineer.\nUpvote\n(6)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago\nZepeng She\n🎉 Congrats Andrew @andrewsthoughts and team on the Zencoder launch! Love how deeply it integrates with IDEs and the Repo Grokking tech—game-changer for large codebases! 🔥 The 20+ DevOps integrations (JIRA + Sentry combo? 👏) and unit testing agent make \"speed + quality\" feel achievable.\nOne ask: Any plans for a CLI tool/API access? That’d make CI/CD automation chef’s kiss.\nPS: How are you prioritizing SWE-Bench improvements vs. new integrations? Rooting for you! 🚀\nUpvote\n(10)\nReport\nShare\n13h ago\nVibor Cipan\nMaker\n@andrewsthoughts @rocsheh Thanks for the congrats and support! I'm happy you love the IDE integrations and Repo Grokking — key for large codebases.\n\nThe 20+ DevOps integrations, including Jira and Sentry, plus the unit testing agent, are designed for that ‘speed + quality’ balance you are mentioning.\n\nNo CLI/API access yet, but we’re demoing MCP (Model Context Protocol) support at our 6 PM CET webinar—stay tuned: https://zencoder.ai/webinars/maximize-productivity-with-zencoder.\n\nOn SWE-Bench, it’s a very useful benchmark, but we prioritize real dev productivity and ease of use—SWE-Bench just quantifies those gains in some aspects.
