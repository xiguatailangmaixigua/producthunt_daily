    "maker_introduction": "Hey Product Hunt fam! 👋🏻 I'm Lea, co-founder of TalkMe AI.\n\nYears ago, I found myself in a situation where I had studied a language for ages, but when it came time to actually talk to someone, my brain just…froze. It felt like all those hours of studying were locked behind a door I couldn't open. And I realized, it wasn't just me. So many people face this – the gap between textbook learning and real-world conversation.\n\nThat's why we built TalkMe AI. We wanted to bridge that gap, to create a space where language learning isn't just about memorizing rules, but about having real conversations.\n\nSo, what does TalkMe actually do?\n📚 Personalized Study Plan: We craft lessons based on your interests, language level and needs. Everything is made to suit you!\n⌚️ Real-Time Feedback: Our AI doesn't just talk; it listens and guides, helping you nail pronunciation and grammar.\n👩🏻 Ultra-realistic AI Avatars: TalkMe's Al tutors come from all over the world, with diverse backgrounds, personalities, and accents, and can respond according to the context.\n💬 Everyday Scenarios: From ordering coffee to pitching a business idea, we've got you covered. You can even create your own scenarios.\n👑 Track Your Wins: See your progress, review what you've learned, and compete with users in leaderboards.\n\nWe're all about making language learning adaptive, effective, flexible, and affordable.\n\n🎁 To celebrate our launch here on Product Hunt, we're offering a special deal for our new friends: Use code 【999999】 for a sweet 52% off on our annual plan.\n\nPlease support us and let's make language learning an adventure, not a chore!\n\n- Website: https://talkme.ai/\n- Instagram: talkme.ai\n- Contact Us: business@talkme.ai",

After collaboration with our early access partners, this functionality is now available to all users.\n\nFeedback from these early adopters has been overwhelmingly positive, with many reporting that it has significantly reduced time to value and streamlined their workflows.\n\n\"Avery just blew my mind, how did it know what captions to generate!?\"\n\"It saves a lot of time for creation. Very nice addition.\"\n\"It took me two minutes to do something that took me two hours with other software.\"\n\nSince quietly releasing this a few weeks ago, we’ve seen a record number of Arcades published. We’re launching this feature free of charge for all users during the initial rollout phase. Over the next month, we’ll be gathering feedback to fine-tune the experience and ensure it meets your needs. Long-term, automated hotspot generation will become a paid feature, so now is the perfect time to try it out and let us know what you think!\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n1d ago",

This is the 2.0 launch of my personal budgeting app, Bread Budgeting!\n\nI initially created this app because I had been told by so many people that they wanted to get into the habit of budgeting and planning their personal finances, but didn't want to resort to using an excel spreadsheet or some other clunky software. Hence the idea of bread budgeting was born. \n\nThe core idea is that you keep within your budget every month to earn new bread characters, and keep Brad the bread alive. Stray beyond your self-defined limits, and Brad will be toast! (literally)\n\nIn the past year, based on feedback from our amazing community, we have added a plethora of new features, including the ability to add friends and your partner to budget together. See how everyone else is doing on their goals, and flex your earned breads on your personal profile!\n\nWe have also added new visualisations and insights, such as a recurring transaction calendar, to keep track of those pesky subscriptions, and an annual dashboard view, to get an even better understanding of your own spending habits. \n\nWe hope you enjoy the app, and please let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions!\nUpvote\n(1)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago",
