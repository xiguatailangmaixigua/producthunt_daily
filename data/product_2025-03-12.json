    "maker_introduction": "📌\nHi PH community, I’m Yurii, the founder of Fluently✌️ Great to meet you all! Huge thanks to @garrytan and @Y Combinator for the hunt.\n\nI built Fluently because I know personally how challenging it can be to speak English, especially on important calls. Even when you know the right words, hesitation and uncertainty can still hold you back.\n\nUnlike other apps that teach the basics, Fluently is for people who already know English but want to speak more clearly, confidently, and naturally. Our AI analyzes your real speech, identifies your challenges, and builds a personalized improvement plan based on your current level and mistakes.\n\nWe also have an AI tutor that helps you practice more and prepares you for all your important calls in English. It’s like having a human tutor—but available 24/7 and 15 times cheaper.\n\nNo scripts, no generic lessons, just real-world practice that will make you progress in your English speaking skills.\nExcited to hear your thoughts 🚀\nUpvote\n(45)\nReport\nShare\n17h ago\nRoman Evstigneev\n@rebryk Congrats on launch, Yurii! 🚀 Been using the free version for a few months now, and it’s a game-changer for real-world practice\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n17h ago\nDima Kim\nVenture Roof\n@garrytan @rebryk God Speed, my friend!\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n16h ago\nIslam Midov\n2pr\n@garrytan @rebryk congrats with a launch! what's feature of fluently you personally love the most?\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n15h ago\nDineshan\nLaunching soon!\n@garrytan @rebryk Speaking confidently in real conversations is the hardest part of learning a language, and Fluently's AI-driven approach makes it so much easier.

    "maker_introduction": "Hey Product Hunt! I'm Zach, founder of Embra. 👋\n\n18 months ago, we pivoted to build \"An AI that knows the business better than the CEO.\" After a lot of grinding and late nights, we're excited to share Embra with you!\n\n⚡ Recent win: I asked Embra to plan our Q2. It deep-searched through our call notes, customer emails, roadmap, and product specs, delivering a 90% accurate 12-point plan in 2 minutes. This would have taken us days.\n\nSurprisingly, Embra wasn't designed for strategy! It evolved naturally as we focused on saving product & sales people an hour/day. The more it handled their busywork, the faster it learned their business. The holy grail was a tool where we could just talk to customers/leads, and get PRDs out the other end. We're there now.\n\nEmbra can do a lot for your business:\nTake perfect notes and make them easy for you (and Embra) to use later\nDraft follow-up emails, in your tone and with the right content\nUpdate the CRM\nTrack all the work: action items, projects & decisions\nLog feature requests, bug reports, and user feedback\nCoach team members after every important call\nCreate personalized nudge emails with a click\nReplace cold, robotic sequences with natural emails that keep you in the relationship\n\nWhat makes Embra an AI Operating System:\n\n🧠 All the work, in one place: Meeting notes, AI chat, CRM, research, and scheduling all in one. Building the best brain for an AI meant it needed to ingest all communication data. One user's development team in Turkey sends notes that arrive automatically translated!\n\n🤖 Interconnected agents: In other tools, agents run when you ask them to. In Embra, agents react to changes in your business. When a customer mentioned a competitor, Embra extracted, researched, and created a report—with a full sales report coming Monday.\n\n🏋️ Humans in the loop: Embra agents let your team review work before it goes out, sending drafts to your AI inbox for approval. Friends don’t let AI friends do dangerous tasks alone…\n\nTry Embra free today! Our team is here all day to answer your questions below! 🚀💡",
