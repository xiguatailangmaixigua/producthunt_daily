    "maker_introduction": "üìå\nHi, We‚Äôre a small team of OS, virtualization, and ML engineers, and after three years of development, we‚Äôre thrilled to launch the beta of our CUDA abstraction layer! We decouple the Kernel Shader execution from applications that use CUDA into a Wooly Abstraction layer. In this abstraction layer, we compile these to a new binary, and Shaders are compiled into a Wooly Instruction Set. At runtime, Kernel Shader launch events initiate a transfer of Shader over the network from a CPU host to a GPU host, where they are recompiled. Their execution is managed by Wooly Server software to achieve maximum GPU resource utilization, isolation between workloads, and cross-compatibility with hardware vendors before being converted to be passed on to the respective GPU hardware runtime and drivers. In principle, the wooly abstraction layer is similar to an Operating System, which sits on top of the hardware and enables the most efficient and reliable execution of multiple workloads.\nWe built a GPU Cloud service(WoolyAi Acceleration Service) using this abstraction layer with \"Actual GPU Resources Used\" billing, NOT \"GPU Time Used\" billing.\n\nLooking forward to getting your feedback and comments.\nUpvote\n(1)\nReport\nShare\n1d ago\nMasum Parvej\n@manisha_arora6 How does the Wooly Instruction Set handle vendor-specific optimizations across different GPUs?\nUpvote\nReport\nShare\n1h ago\nAbout this launch\nWoolyAI Acceleration Service\nGPU Service with GPU Core and Memory Resources Used billing\nFollow\n65\nPoints\n2\nComments\n-\nDay Rank\n-\nWeek Rank\nWoolyAI Acceleration Service by WoolyAI Acceleration Service was hunted by Manisha Arora in SaaS, Developer Tools, Data Science.
