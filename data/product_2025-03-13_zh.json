    "maker_introduction": "Hey Product Hunt,\n\nI’m Tanay, co-founder & CEO of Wispr Flow. A few months ago, we released Flow 1.0 on Mac to help people write at the speed of thought — no cramped fingers, no jarring typos. The response was incredible, but one question kept coming up from a lot of ProductHunters: “When do Windows users get to ditch their keyboards?”\n\nToday, Wispr Flow is finally available on Windows — bringing voice-first dictation (and instant auto-edits) to PCs everywhere.\n\n⭐ Here’s what to expect:\n\n3x Faster Than Typing\nSpeak naturally and watch Flow handle the formatting and grammar in real time.\n\nAdaptive Style\nFlow picks up on your personal quirks—so your text sounds like you wrote it yourself, not a bot.\n\nEasy Voice Commands\nNeed a fresh tone or a quick AI rewrite? Say the command, and Flow transforms your text without leaving your current app.\n\nFlexible & Cross-Platform\nWhether you’re on Slack, Word, or any web-based tool, Flow integrates seamlessly—plus it syncs with our Mac version if you switch between devices.\n\nNew Privacy Mode\nWith a new Privacy mode, none of your dictation data will be stored or used for model training by us or any third party (zero data retention).\n\n⭐ Our vision:\n\nWe want to build an intuitive interface where\ninteracting with it feels as natural as interacting with people\nit understands you, perhaps even better than you understand yourself\nit is seamlessly accessible, and feels like an extension of your identity\nLetting people express their thoughts with Flow is our first step in that journey, with a lot more coming later this year.\nI’d love to hear your thoughts—drop a comment below, share feedback, and if you find Flow helpful, I’d really appreciate your upvote.\n\nThanks for checking us out and for helping us shape the future of voice computing!\n\n-- Written with @Wispr Flow\n\nWith ❤️\nTanay & The Wispr Flow Team\nUpvote\n(21)\nReport\nShare\n9d ago\nMasum Parvej\n@tanaykothari Love the adaptive style feature!\nUpvote\n(2)\nReport\nShare\n12h ago\nTanay Kothari\nWispr Flow\nMaker\n@masump Personalization is the future\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n12h ago\nDmitry Mishunin\n@tanaykothari Wispr Flow looks solid! As someone who spends hours typing every day, the idea of writing at the speed of thought with voice dictation is really appealing. The adaptive style feature is great—it’s nice to have text that actually sounds like me. Good job on the launch!\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n11h ago\nAriel Fox\nMaker\nWriting at this speed of thought has completely changed the game for me, too @mewdoro. Whether I'm using Flow at work to connect with customers and teammates or catching up with friends and family on WhatsApp, having Flow sound like me without having to physically type is incredible.\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n11h ago\nDineshan\nLaunching soon!\n@tanaykothari It’s like a futuristic dream come true! Love how it works seamlessly across apps, and keeps privacy a priority. Congrats on the launch!\nUpvote\n(3)\nReport\nShare\n10h ago\nshow more replies\nRajiv Ayyangar\nProduct Hunt\nHunter\nI've been using Wispr Flow for a few weeks now, and it's impressed me with how quick and seamless it is. It's actually changed a lot of my behavior; I'm finding myself dictating way more than writing. I've even been dictating while on a call - I'll just mute very quickly and dictate for a bit, and then unmute. It's pretty cool that now it's available on Windows!\nUpvote\n(9)\nReport\nShare\n2d ago\nConstanza Hasselmann\nWispr Flow\nMaker\nI also use Flow as I'm speaking next steps at the end of a meeting - small but mighty hack 💪 Glad to hear you're enjoying Flow,@rajiv_ayyangar!\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n12h ago\nRajiv Ayyangar\nProduct Hunt\nHunter\n@constanza_h The duality of speaking to people in a meeting and having it written down in the same breath is underrated.\nUpvote\nReport\nShare\n1h ago\nJaisal Kothari\nI've been using Flow for about a year now, and I've genuinely seen a boost in my productivity. My favorite use case is with Cursor to quickly make it understand what exactly I need – in natural language. What would take me minutes to write out, now takes seconds with Flow. It's insanely fast and genuinely feels like magic.\nUpvote\n(6)\nReport\nShare\n13h ago\nConstanza Hasselmann\nWispr Flow\nMaker\nCheck out our Workflows Gallery for more on using Flow + Cursor,@jaisal_kothari !

Wispr Flow will be a great helper for people like us who are prone to making typos.\nUpvote\n(4)\nReport\nShare\n11h ago\nAriel Fox\nMaker\n@feliciana_liu Tell me about it. I still can't spell 'convenience', 'restaurant' or 'definitely' without getting it wrong.
