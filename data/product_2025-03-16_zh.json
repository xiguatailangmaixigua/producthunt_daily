    "label": "Create custom vector illustrations in seconds",
    "maker_introduction": "Hey Product Hunt! 👋\n\nI’m so excited (and a little nervous!) to finally launch IllustraAI here!\n\nA little backstory — I’m an indie hacker who loves design. Over the past few years, I’ve built several projects, and one thing I kept running into was the struggle to find good, custom illustrations. Stock images felt too generic, custom artwork was often expensive, and I didn’t always have the time (or skill!) to create my own.\n\nThat’s when the idea for IllustraAI hit me. What if there was a faster, easier way to get high-quality, unique vector illustrations — tailored exactly to your needs — just by describing what you wanted?\n\nSo I built it! With IllustraAI, you can generate beautiful, scalable SVG illustrations in seconds — perfect for websites, apps, marketing materials, and more. No more digging through endless stock libraries or paying a fortune for custom work.\n\nThis project has been a labor of love, and seeing it go from a simple idea to a real product people actually use has been incredible. I’d love to hear what you think! If you have any feedback, ideas, or just want to say hi, drop a comment — I’ll be here all day.\n\nThank you so much for your support! 💜\n\n— Evan",
